# About Me
I'm a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area and have spent the last
three odd years working to revolutionize agriculture with the Internet of Things.

My first foray into software development was in high school working with Max/MSP and
Arduino microcontrollers to integrate all sorts of hardware controllers and sensors with Ableton Live for
music performance and production. Once running with that, I never really stopped!

In 2017, I received my Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering
from the University of Colorado with an emphasis in Digital Signal Processing.

In my time there, I found myself stumbling into the AgTech space with my
[Capstone Senior Design Project](https://charliekingprojects.wordpress.com/2017/01/01/the-robotic-yard-weeder-part-1/),
where we sought to use computer vision to help automate the administation
of herbicides and further reduce water polution.

After finishing the project and searching for my next endeavor, I inadvertantly found myself
stumbling straight back into AgTech with a career at vertical farming startup [Plenty](https://plenty.ag),
where I currently work as a Software Engineer on the Platform team.

Since then, my interest in software design has exploded, and I continue to learn and practice as much as I can 
both personally and professionally, documenting my work and findings here. Check out my
[blog](/) for more information on projects I'm working on, or take a minute to read my
[introduction](/2020/09/28/hello.html).

In my free time, you can typically find me rock climbing or working on music. Hopefully soon enough I'll be able to
share more of that here!
